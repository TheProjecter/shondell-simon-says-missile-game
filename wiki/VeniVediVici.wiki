You should be close to a final product by now (except for the inevitable troubleshooting phase)

Couple of things:
  * The big buttons are Nerf balls cut in half. You may have to cut a notch into them so the switches fit without accidentally clocking them.
  * Make sure the connection from the air pump to the missile launch tube is airtight.
  * In the time I gave myself for this project, I couldn't get the RF receiver circuit to run off of a battery. It needs a 5V source, which was originally fueled by 4 AA batteries. But, this weighs down the missile too much. I'm sure you can figure it out, though.
